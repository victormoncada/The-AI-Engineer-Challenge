## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and transitions
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons
- **React Markdown** - Markdown rendering for AI responses
- **React Dropzone** - File upload functionality
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests

## Customization

### Styling
The app uses CSS modules and custom properties for easy theming. Main color variables are defined in the CSS files and can be easily modified.

### API Endpoints
Update the API endpoints in the component files if your backend runs on a different port or domain.

### Models
Add or modify available AI models in the `ChatInterface.js` component.

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm eject` - Eject from Create React App

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with optimized production files.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key not working**
   - Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check that the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`

2. **CORS errors**
   - Make sure the backend has CORS enabled for `http://localhost:3000`

3. **File upload not working**
   - Ensure the backend has the document upload endpoint implemented
   - Check file size limits and supported formats

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the backend API is running and accessible
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
