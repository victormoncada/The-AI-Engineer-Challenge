At work, AI is performing workplace tasks by either augmenting or automating human labor. Users leverage generative AI for producing writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products, distinguishing it from traditional web search engines. People also use AI with different intents, including asking for information or advice, doing tasks, and expressing themselves. Moreover, AI agents can act as co-workers producing output or as co-pilots providing advice and boosting human problem-solving productivity. Additionally, use cases include personal self-expression such as relationships, personal reflection, games, and role play, though these make up smaller portions of usage. Overall, generative AI is flexible and widely applied for enhancing productivity, creativity, and information-seeking.\\n\\nIn summary: People are using AI to augment or automate workplace tasks, generate digital content (writing, code, spreadsheets), seek information and advice, improve productivity, and engage in personal self-expression and entertainment.'"
